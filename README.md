# E-Commerce Data Analysis & Customer Segmentation Project

## 📖 Project Overview

This project conducts a deep-dive analysis of a transnational e-commerce dataset to uncover actionable business insights. The goal was to move beyond simple reporting and build a data-driven framework for understanding customer behavior, optimizing marketing strategies, and driving revenue growth. The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard and a strategic executive summary.

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Who are our most valuable customers and how do we retain them?
- What are the sales trends and how can we optimize operations?
- Which products and regions present the biggest opportunities?
- Why do customers churn and how can we win them back?

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Database:** SQL (for data wrangling)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Methodologies:** RFM Analysis, Cohort Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Data Cleaning & Wrangling

## 📈 Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle - Online Retail II Dataset]
- **Description:** A transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between [Date Range, e.g., 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011].
- **Size:** [Number] of transactions, [Number] of customers, [Number] of products.
- **Original Columns:** InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The raw data required extensive cleaning to ensure analytical integrity. A nuanced, two-tiered approach was used to handle different business contexts.

### 1. Data Type Conversion
- Converted `InvoiceDate` to a datetime object for time-series analysis.
- Converted `CustomerID` to a string (`object`) type to represent it as a unique identifier.

### 2. Handling Duplicate Records
- **Issue:** 5,268 records were exact duplicates across all columns.
- **Root Cause:** Determined to be system errors in data logging.
- **Action:** Removed all duplicate rows, keeping only the first occurrence.
- **Impact:** Prevented artificial inflation of sales metrics.

### 3. Handling Missing Values
- **Issue:** 25% of `CustomerID` values were missing.
- **Investigation:** These records were primarily for operational items (e.g., 'DOTCOM POSTAGE', 'JUMBO BAG') and system adjustments, not representative of customer purchases.
- **Action:** Implemented a segmented approach:
  - **`business_df`:** Kept all records for accurate financial reporting.
  - **`analysis_df`:** Removed records with null `CustomerID` for clean customer behavior analysis.

### 4. Handling Invalid and Extreme Values
- **Investigation:** Negative values in `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` represented valid business actions like **returns** and **accounting adjustments**. Extremely high quantities indicated **wholesale orders**, and high prices were **operational fees**.
- **Action:** Created a refined `analysis_df` for customer behavior by applying filters:
  - `Quantity > 0` and `UnitPrice > 0`
  - Capped quantities and prices at reasonable thresholds for retail.
  - Filtered out transactions with non-product descriptions (e.g., 'POSTAGE', 'FEE').

**Final Datasets:**
- **`business_df`:** The complete dataset for accurate financial calculations.
- **`analysis_df`:** The cleaned subset for analyzing customer and product behavior.

## 🧮 Analysis & Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted a thorough univariate and multivariate analysis to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Sales trends over time, daily/weekly/hourly patterns.
- **Geographic Analysis:** Revenue and order distribution by country.
- **Product Analysis:** Identification of best/worst-selling products and categories.

### 2. RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
Segmented the customer base into distinct groups for targeted marketing.
- **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase.
- **Frequency (F):** Number of transactions.
- **Monetary (M):** Total revenue from the customer.
- **Segments Identified:**
  - **Champions:** Best customers, drive the majority of revenue.
  - **Loyal Customers:** Reliable, consistent purchasers.
  - **Potential Loyalists:** Recent customers with high potential.
  - **At-Risk Customers:** High-value customers who are churning.
  - **Needs Attention:** Dormant, low-engagement customers.

### 3. Cohort Analysis
Analyzed customer retention rates over time.
- **Method:** Grouped customers by their acquisition month and tracked the percentage who made purchases in subsequent months.
- **Key Insight:** Identified a concerning trend of declining retention rates throughout 2011, highlighting a need for improved customer onboarding and engagement.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

### Customer Behavior
- **The 80/20 Rule is Evident:** The top segment ("Champions"), comprising only 643 customers, generates a massively disproportionate amount of revenue.
- **Retention is a Key Opportunity:** Cohort analysis reveals a significant drop-off in customers after 3 months.
- **Clear Shopping Patterns:** Sales peak on **Thursdays** and during **mid-day hours (10 AM - 3 PM)**, which generates nearly **80% of daily revenue**.

### Product & Sales Analysis
- **Top Product:** "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER" is the top revenue-generating product ($142K).
- **Market Concentration:** The UK drives over 80% of all revenue. The Netherlands shows a higher value per order than Germany, suggesting an untapped opportunity.

## 🚀 Executive Summary & Business Recommendations

The analysis was synthesized into a strategic document for decision-makers. Key recommendations include:

1.  **Launch a VIP Program:** Protect and reward "Champion" customers to secure the company's largest revenue stream.
2.  **Execute Targeted Win-Back Campaigns:** Re-engage high-value "At-Risk" customers with urgent, personalized offers.
3.  **Optimize Marketing Spend:** Reallocate ad budget to target the Netherlands based on its higher value per order and focus campaigns on high-conversion days (Thu) and times (10 AM - 3 PM).
4.  **Improve New Customer Onboarding:** Address the declining retention trend with a structured nurture program for new signups.
